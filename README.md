###### PROGRAMMING MODEL

The idea is to be able to use a mips32 gcc compiler and then convert the 32 bit mips to this custom 16 bit mips style CPU/ISA.

#SPECS
#The CPU has the following specifications

* 16 bit data
* 32 integer registers
* 128 words of RAM
* 32 input ports with registers
* 32 output ports
* 6 stage pipeline
* 22 tick clock
